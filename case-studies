## Digital assistant for clinic

**Client:** Poorna Neuro
**Use case:** 24/7 patient queries
**Channels:** Voice and text
**Languages:** English, Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam

### Challenge

* Patients needed doctor, service and location details outside clinic hours, but had no way to get instant answers. 
* Administrative staff were overloaded with repetitive queries, pulling time from complex tasks. 
* The clinic wanted consistent, accurate, multilingual information for a diverse patient base. 

### Solution

* Built ‘Dhi’, a natural voice and text assistant with low‑latency audio for hands‑free conversations. 
* Full multilingual support across six regional languages to maximise accessibility. 
* Safety guardrails that restrict knowledge to verified clinic information and politely decline medical advice. 

### Results

* Patients receive instant, accurate answers at any hour, in their preferred language and mode. 
* Staff time is freed for scheduling, billing and patient care, improving operational efficiency. 
* A modern digital front door that strengthens the clinic’s brand and accessibility. 

## AI service desk co‑pilot

**Client:** Customer support team in insurance
**Use case:** Live agent augmentation
**Channels:** In‑chat guidance

### Challenge

* Service quality varied in stressful live chats and empathy was inconsistent. 
* Agents spent time identifying intent and sentiment, extracting policy data and searching knowledge. 
* No real‑time procedural guidance on next best actions, which increased handling time and errors. 

### Solution

* Live analysis of customer intent and sentiment so agents understand goals and tone instantly. 
* One‑click suggested replies plus automatic extraction of key details like policy numbers and names. 
* Contextual checklists and quick actions, for example opening a claim form directly from the chat. 

### Results

* Faster resolutions with fewer errors through real‑time co‑pilot support. 
* More consistent, empathetic responses that raise service quality. 
* Lower training time and higher agent productivity, leading to happier customers.
